# Warnings
All scripts do not venture into the orders section of the chart but, as always, **use at your own risk** and make sure to test all commands on a test patient. It is generally recommended to keep an eye on all processes.

## General Information
* using the script *"as-is"* will disable capslock entirely
* use ctrl-f inside the script to find the portions of the script which may or may not need to be modified depending on your setup

## Requirements
* the main screen (aka launchpoint) needs to be set at 75%, otherwise, many of the commands on that screen may not work
* the main screen toolbar must be set by unchecking all options under View > Toolbar > Navigation Toolbar and enabling the "Patient Toolbar" under View > Toolbar >
* all code listed below that is labeled REQUIRED
* knowledge on how to edit Autohotkey (use google)

## Included Files
* Autohotkey executable with stable macros
* Macros.ahk file with macros currently being tested and some personal extras for use with other programs

## Vocabulary
* **Key Combination** – the keyboard keys that need to be pressed.
* **Hot String** – the typed phrase that will automatically execute the macro.

## Updates
*This section is to provide in easy-to-read area for users to read up on what changes have been made and what is being worked on.*

* **11/21/18:** Adding README, explanations, and broken down code for user customization.
* **12/01/18:** Added toolbar setup to prevent the buttons from "stealing" keyboard shortcuts.
* **02/12/19:** Added more code snippets and macros.
* **04/16/19:** Working to update the scripts to function with the recent changes.

## TODO
- [X] update the readme
- [X] needs a prelude description to ensure user setup is correct
- [ ] update to be in line with new system changes
- [ ] make all text snippets universal, making the hotstrings and hotkey universal
- [ ] website for easier navigation
